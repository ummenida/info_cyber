# Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Cybersecurity
## Core Concepts

### Role of AI/ML in Cybersecurity

- Machine Learning for intrusion detection and malware analysis
- Predictive analytics for attack prevention
- AI-driven SOC automation (SOAR tools)

### AI Techniques in Security
- Supervised learning: Malware classification (Benign vs Malicious)
- Unsupervised learning: Anomaly detection in logs
- Reinforcement learning: Adaptive response systems

### AI Techniques in Security
- **Supervised learning**: Malware classification (Benign vs Malicious)
- **Unsupervised learning**: Anomaly detection in logs
- **Reinforcement learning**: Adaptive response systems

### Applications of AI in Threat Detection
- **Email phishing detection** using NLP
- **Behavior-based endpoint protection**
- **Network traffic anomaly detection** (IDS/IPS enhancement)
- **User and Entity Behavior Analytics** (UEBA)

### AI-Powered Tools & Platforms
- **IBM QRadar Advisor with Watson**
