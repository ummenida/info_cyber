# Fundamentals of Computer Security

## Identification, Authentication, and Authorization

| Concept            | Description          | Example                             |
|--------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Identification** | Claiming an identity | Typing username                     |
| **Authentication** | Proving identity     | Entering password / fingerprint     |
| **Authorization**  | Granting access      | Accessing certain files after login |

## Key Principle:
“Authentication verifies who you are. Authorization decides what you can do.”

# Authentication Methods
- Knowledge-based: Passwords, PINs
- Possession-based: Smart cards, OTP tokens
- Inherence-based: Biometrics (fingerprint, face ID)
- Multifactor Authentication (MFA): Combination of 2 or more above
- Single Sign-On (SSO): One-time login across multiple systems (e.g., Google or Microsoft SSO)


# Authorization Models
- DAC (Discretionary Access Control): Owner decides who can access (Windows permissions).
- MAC (Mandatory Access Control): Access based on classification levels (military system).
- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control): Permissions assigned to roles (Admin, Manager, user).
- ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control): Access based on conditions (time, location, user type).
  
## Example:
An "HR Manager" role can view employee data, while "Employee" role can only view their own profile.

# Best Practices
- Use strong, unique passwords.
- Apply MFA wherever possible.
- Review role-based permissions regularly.
- Log all authentication and access events.
