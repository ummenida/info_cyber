# Encryption Techniques

## Learning Objectives
- **Understand cryptography basics.**
- **Differentiate between symmetric and asymmetric encryption.**
- **Learn hashing and digital signature concepts.**

## Cryptography
Cryptography is a technique of securing information and communications using codes to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.

### Symmetric Encryption
- Uses one key for both encryption and decryption.
- Fast, suitable for bulk data encryption.

### Asymmetric Encryption
- Uses two keys: Public Key (for encryption) & Private Key (for decryption).
- Used for secure key exchange and digital communication.

### Hashing
- Converts data into a fixed-length string.
- One-way process - cannot be reversed.
- Used for password storage and integrity checking.
- **Common Algorithms**: SHA-256, MD5 (deprecated)

### Digital Signatures and Certificates
- Ensure authenticity and non-repudiation.
- A digital signature uses a private key to sign data and public key to verify it.
- Certificates (X.509) are issued by Certificate Authorities (CAs) for trust verification (used in HTTPS).

  ## Example :
  While visiting https://bank.com
  - Browser verifies the certificates signed by CA to ensure authenticity.
