# Security Principles
## Learning Objectives
- Understand the CIA Triad and its importance.
- Explain Risk, Privacy, and Accountability.
- Relate security principles to real-world cyber incident.

# CIA Triad
- The CIA Triad forms the foundation of information security.
- each element ensures that information remains safe and trustworthy.

| Element               | Description                                                  | Example                                                  |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Confidentiality**   | Ensures data is accessible only to autgorised users          | Encrypting files, using passwords, access control lists. |
| **Integrity**         | ensures data is accurate, consistent, and not tampered with. | Using hashing, digital signatures, checksum.             |
| **Availabilty**       | ensures systems and data are available when needed.          | Reduntant servers, backups, DDos protection.             |

# Risk, Privacy, Accountability
## Risk 
- Defnition: Probability of a threat exploiting a vulnerability to cause harm.
## Components:
- Threat->something that can cause damage
- Vulnerabilty-> weakness that can be exploited
- Impact-> damage if threat is realized
## Formula:
Risk = threat x vulnerablilty x Impact
## Example:
- Threat-> Phishing
- Vulnerability-> Employee lack of awarness
- Impact-> credential theft, financial loss

#Privacy
- Protecting personal and sensitive information of individual.
- Governed by laws like GDPR, DPDP Act(India), HIPAA.

##Key Practises:
- Data minimization
- Informed consent
- Data anonymization
Example: A healthcare app must not share user health data without consent

#Accountability
Ensuring every action in an IT system can be traced back to an individual.
## Acheived through
- Logging and auditing
- User accss tracking
- Non-repudiation mechanisms
Example: audit logs in firewalls to trace malicious user actions.
