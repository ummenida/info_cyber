# Security Principles
## Learning Objectives:
- Understand the CIA Triad and its importance.
- Explain Risk, Privacy, and Accountability.
- Relate security principles to real-world cyber incidents.

## CIA Triad
- The CIA Triad forms the foundation of information security.
- Each element ensures that information remains safe and trustworthy.

| Element           | Description                                                                 | Example                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Confidentiality** | Ensures data is accessible only to authorized users.                        | Encrypting files, using passwords, access control lists.                |
| **Integrity**      | Ensures data is accurate, consistent, and not tampered with.                | Using hashing, digital signatures, checksums.                           |
| **Availability**   | Ensures systems and data are available when needed.                         | Redundant servers, backups, DDoS protection.                            |

# Key Concepts
- Data breaches often occur when one or more CIA principles are compromised.
- Balance is key â€“ too much focus on one (e.g., availability) can weaken another (e.g., confidentiality).
# Examples
- **Confidentiality Violation:** Unauthorized access to customer data (e.g., Facebook-Cambridge Analytica case).
- **Integrity Violation:** Tampered medical data in hospitals leading to misdiagnosis.
- **Availability Violation:** DDoS attack on banking websites preventing service access.

# Risk, Privacy, and Accountability

# Risk
- **Definition:** Probability of a threat exploiting a vulnerability to cause harm.

## Components:
- **Threat:** something that can cause damage.
- **Vulnerability:** weakness that can be exploited.
- **Impact:** damage if threat is realized.

## Formula:
 **Risk = Threat x Vulnerability x Impact**

## Example:
- **Threat:** Phishing
